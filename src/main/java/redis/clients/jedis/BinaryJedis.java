     * way. Note that if offset is large the commands needs to traverse the list
     * for offset elements and this adds up to the O(M) figure.
     * <p>
     * The {@link #zcount(String, double, double) ZCOUNT} command is similar to
     * {@link #zrangeByScore(String, double, double) ZRANGEBYSCORE} but instead
     * of returning the actual elements in the specified interval, it just
     * returns the number of matching elements.
     * <p>
     * <b>Exclusive intervals and infinity</b>
     * <p>
     * min and max can be -inf and +inf, so that you are not required to know
     * what's the greatest or smallest element in order to take, for instance,
     * elements "up to a given value".
     * <p>
     * Also while the interval is for default closed (inclusive) it's possible
     * to specify open intervals prefixing the score with a "(" character, so
     * for instance:
     * <p>
     * {@code ZRANGEBYSCORE zset (1.3 5}
     * <p>
     * Will return all the values with score > 1.3 and <= 5, while for instance:
     * <p>
     * {@code ZRANGEBYSCORE zset (5 (10}
     * <p>
     * Will return all the values with score > 5 and < 10 (5 and 10 excluded).
     * <p>
     * <b>Time complexity:</b>
     * <p>
     * O(log(N))+O(M) with N being the number of elements in the sorted set and
     * M the number of elements returned by the command, so if M is constant
     * (for instance you always ask for the first ten elements with LIMIT) you
     * can consider it O(log(N))
